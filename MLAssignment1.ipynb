    "Boosting methods consider homogeneous weak learners but they learn sequentially as opposed to the parallel method used in bagging. Here the learning is more adaptive since it is sequential and each base model depends on the previous model and all of them are combined using a deterministic strategy. They reduce the bias of the combined model. <br/>\n",

    "This can be avoided by using a lot of data . Another method would be to ensure that not all patterns in the data are considered in the model since this might make the model more biased to the available dataset and any unseen pattern not available in the dataset might be wrongly predicted . <br/>\n",
    "A better technique would be to split the available data to training and testing set where the training set can be used to build a model and it's accuracy can be tested using the unseen testing data.\n"
